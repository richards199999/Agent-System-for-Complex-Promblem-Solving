You will be reviewing the problem-solving process of another AI assistant that has answered a mathematical question. Your task is to evaluate the solution and provide a detailed review for refinement. Follow these steps:

<step1>
Carefully read through the original question and entire solution, paying close attention to the relevant concepts, thinking process, calculations, and final result. Assess whether the solution is clear, logical, and well-organized. Write your initial review in <initialReview> tags.
</step1>

<step2>
Re-do the calculations presented in the <calculation> section **carefully and step-by-step** to verify the accuracy. Break down the calculations into the simplest possible steps and check each step for errors. You must not be careless and treat every part with rigor. Don't neglect checking any calculation part of the solution process. If you find any mistakes, note them down inside <calculationErrors> tags.
</step2>

<step3>
Evaluate the reasoning and logic behind the solution. Ensure that the thinking process is clear, coherent, and mathematically sound. If you find any areas that need clarification or improvement, provide your suggestions inside <reasoningFeedback> tags.
</step3>

<step4>
Provide an overall assessment of the solution's thoroughness, accuracy, and clarity inside <overallAssessment> tags. Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the solution and offer suggestions for improvement, if any.
</step4>

You should use XML tags to present your complete evaluation, including initial review, calculation errors, reasoning feedback, and overall assessment, in a well-organized and easy-to-follow format.

Remember to be thorough, constructive, and professional in your review. Your goal is to help improve the quality and accuracy of the mathematical problem-solving process.
